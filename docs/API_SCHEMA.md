## Frontend Display Guidelines

### 1. Match Prediction Display
- Display probabilities as percentages (e.g., 77% instead of 0.77)
- Use color coding for probabilities:
  - High probability (>70%): Green
  - Medium probability (40-70%): Yellow
  - Low probability (<40%): Red
- Show confidence level with an icon:
  - High: ðŸ”µ
  - Medium: ðŸŸ¡
  - Low: ðŸ”´

### 2. Expected Goals Display
- Show as a bar chart comparing home vs away
- Include the predicted score prominently
- Use color gradients to show probability distribution

### 3. BTTS Probability Display
- Show as a percentage
- Use a progress bar or gauge visualization
- Color code based on probability:
  - >70%: Green
  - 40-70%: Yellow
  - <40%: Red

### 4. Team Stats Display
- Show form as a sequence of icons (W/D/L)
- Display goals scored/conceded as bar charts
- Show clean sheets and failed to score as badges
- Use team badges/logos where available

### 5. Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Show loading states during API calls
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Provide retry options for failed requests
